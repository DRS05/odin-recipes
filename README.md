# Odin Recipes

# Project Description
The odin-recipes project is a website that showcases the three most
delicious recipes I found in a span of 5 minutes! The recipes range
from a delicious chicken rice recipe to a questionable microwave
scrambled eggs recipe that may or may not give you salmonella!

# Project Goals
The odin-recipes project is used as playground to practise with my new-found
programming abilities:
* Headers
* Paragraphs
* Links
* Images
* Git / GitHub
* Console Commands

# Future Plans
Eventually there will be way more features implemented to this website! The
future plans I have are:
* Using CSS to make the landing page (index.html) and the recipe pages more
aesthetically pleasing.
* Using Javascript to search for certain recipes on the website.
* Using ReactJS to make it possible for users to create their own recipes.
* Using Mongodb to store all the recipes created by the users.
* Using ExpressJS to host the website on a server.
* Using Javascript to make a login system and store these login details to
Mongodb

(These aren't actually my plans, I just added these future plans as practise)
